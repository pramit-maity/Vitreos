## 1. Not a Substitute for Professional Medical Advice

VITREOS is designed for **informational and educational purposes only.**
Nothing in this application — including but not limited to AI-generated

nutritional recommendations, or triage outputs — constitutes professional
medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it
because of something you have read or seen in this application.

## 2. AI Outputs May Be Inaccurate — Verify With a Doctor

- Are **not trained as certified medical devices**
- Do **not have access to your complete medical history** unless you provide it
- May reflect **biases or limitations** present in their training data

All AI-generated outputs should be treated as a **starting point for discussion**
with a healthcare professional — not as a final or reliable medical conclusion.
Pramit Maity makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the accuracy,
reliability, or completeness of any AI-generated content in this application.
